And the earth was without form, and void; 
and darkness was upon the face of the deep. 
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. 
And the evening and the morning were the first day.
And God made the firmament, 
and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: 
and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. 
And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, 
Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, 
and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; 
and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

**12.2**

Consider the bank database of Figure 12.13, where the primary keys are underlined, and the following SQL query:

```sql
select T.branch_name
from branch T, branch S
where T.assets > S.assets and S.branch_city = "Brooklyn"
```

Write an efficient relational-algebra expression that is equivalent to this
query. Justify your choice.
Answer:

Query:

This expression performs the theta join on the smallest amount of data
possible. It does this by restricting the right hand side operand of the join
to only those branches in Brooklyn, and also eliminating the unneeded
attributes from both the operands.



**12.3[b]**

If $r_1$ is the outer relation, we need $\lceil 800/(M-2) \times 1500+800\rceil$ disk accesses, and $2\lceil 800/(M-2)\rceil$ disk search.

If $r_2$ is the outer relation, we need $\lceil 1500/(M-2) \times 800+1500\rceil$ disk accesses, and $2\lceil 1500/(M-2)\rceil$ disk search.



**12.10**

a. The number of blocks in the main memory buffer available for sorting(M) is $(40\times10^6)/(4\times10^3)=10^4$. The number of blocks containing records of the given relation ($b_r$) is $(40\times10^9)/(4\times10^3) = 10^7$. Then the cost of sorting the relation is: $(NumberofDisk Seeks\times DiskSeekCost)+(Numberof BlockTransfers\times BlockTransferTime).$ Here Disk seek cost is $5\times 10^{-3}$seconds and block transfer time is $10^{-4}$ seconds $(4\times10^3)/(40\times 10^6)$. The number of block transfers is independent of $b_b$ and is equal to $25\times10^6$.

b. $\lceil \log_{M-1}(b_r/M)\rceil$. This is independent of $b_b$. Substituting the values above, we get $\lceil \log_{10^4-1}(10^7/10^4)\rceil$ witch evaluates to 1.

**12.16**

a. Using pipelining, output from the sorting operation on r is written to a buffer B. When B is full, the merge-join processes tuples from B, joining them with tuples from s until B is empty. At this point, the sorting operation is resumed and B is refilled. This process continues until the merge-join is complete.

b. If the sortâ€“merge operations are run in parallel and memory is shared equally between the two, each operation will have only M/2 frames for its memory buffer. This may increase the number of runs required to merge the data.
